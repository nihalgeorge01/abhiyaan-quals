The ROS package for the tasks in section A. <br>
For the first three tasks, there is a launch file in /launch. It will initialise the publisher and subscriber nodes, and the output from subscriber will be printed to the screen. <br>
The last task needs a manual initiation of turtlesim, a call to the /spawn service through terminal, and rosrun section_a turtle_exercise.py
