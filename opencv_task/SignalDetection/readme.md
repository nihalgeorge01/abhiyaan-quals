The first subtask, to output the colour of a highly simplified signal image has been done in the jupyter notebook. <br>
The second subtask, I had to take help of github user 'oflucas' Traffic Light Detection Project. He used the LARA dataset of road images from France, and Ground truth labels also provided by the LARA organisation. His pipeline could use a variety of models provided by Tensorflow, I tested with SSD Mobilenet only. The dataset is around 500 MB, so I have not uploaded it. <br>
